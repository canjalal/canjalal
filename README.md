👋 Hi, I’m @canjalal (Vincent Shuali)
---
- 👀 I make web applications to help people learn and connect with others. I'm also working to conquer barriers to social connection, both societal and personal.
- 🌱 I’m an enthusiast in Ruby on Rails, React.js, Express/Node.js, JavaScript/ES6+, TypeScript, Python, Flask, SQL, and web development in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making education and healthcare accessible and building community feelings in tech
- 📫 How to reach me ... at Ecstatic Dance or the nearest Indian restaurant in SF

I'm a software engineer focused on web development technologies such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, Flask, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

I'm currently working on an app with SF Civic Tech for paraeducators to manage student IEPs, powered by Next.js and TypeScript. As Junior Software Engineer at CommonLit, I created featured text collections in their Library. I also was a main contributor to overhauling their English student assessment system, used by millions of teachers and students in the U.S.

My primary area of interest is building connections, whether it's between electrical signals and beautiful graphs, or between humans of different backgrounds.

Being a former physics professor, my focus is on creating a user experience that is accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable, constructed atop a sophisticated mathematical codebase. I thrive well in a team setting where I can bring my scientific expertise and technical communication to the fore, and where I can geek out about my love of foreign languages, vegetarian Indian food, community feelings, and maps.
