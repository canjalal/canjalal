I'm a software engineer focused on web development technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I'm currently working on a MERN stack app that facilitates anonymous sharing of emotions and statuses. I've also recently created an interactive JavaScript tutorial that teaches graphs to pre-calculus students using the Chart.js library and a randomly generated functions composed of linked list nodes. My primary area of interest is building connections, whether it's between electrical signals and beautiful graphs, or between humans of different backgrounds. Being a former physics professor, my focus is on creating a user experience that is accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable, constructed atop a sophisticated mathematical codebase. I thrive well in a team setting where I can bring my scientific expertise and technical communication to the fore, and where I can geek out about my love of foreign languages, vegetarian Indian food, community feelings, and maps.
